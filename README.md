## 🔍 Key Insights

As a **Business Analyst**, the following actionable insights are derived:

- High-density cities like Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai dominate the restaurant space.

- North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food are the most frequently offered cuisines.

- Higher cost often correlates with better ratings, indicating perceived value.

- Some popular cuisines have poor average ratings, showing a gap between demand and satisfaction.

💡 Recommendations:

- Focus marketing and partnerships in cities with high restaurant density and high user ratings (e.g., Delhi, Bangalore).

- Encourage low-performing cities or cuisines to improve service standards via quality assurance programs.

- Introduce tiered delivery models (e.g., basic vs. premium).

- Promote highly rated cuisines (e.g., Mexican, Continental) that may not be as commonly offered.

- Use pricing strategies based on cost trends — such as highlighting value meals in premium cities.
